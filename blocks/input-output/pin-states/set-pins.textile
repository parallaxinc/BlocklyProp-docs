Setting a property of a set of pins.


h3. Pin properties

!help?f=blocks/input-output/pin-states/resources/set-pins-value-selection.png(set pins)!

* direction
* state

!help?f=blocks/input-output/pin-states/resources/set-pins-state-selection.png(set pins)!

High and low set the state, while toggle changes a high pin into a low pin and the reverse. If the pin was an input pin, it will be changed into an output pin.

Input converts the pin into an input pin, while reverse changes an input pin into an output pin and the reverse.

!help?f=blocks/input-output/pin-states/resources/set-pins-number-pins-selection.png(set pins)!

* number of pins

This will determine how many pins will be changed to the selected state/direction.

!help?f=blocks/input-output/pin-states/resources/set-pins-start-pin-selection.png(set pins)!

* starting pin number

The number picked is the first pin that will be changed, and the number of pins (selected above) after this block will also be changed.
